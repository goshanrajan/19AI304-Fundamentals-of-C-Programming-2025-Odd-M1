# IAPR-1- Module 1 - FoC
## 1. Implementation of basic C programs using Literals,Consonants, Variables, Data types.
## 2. Implementation of different categories of operators.
# Ex.No:1
  Build a C program to demonstrate the usage of different types of literals: integer, float, character, and string.  
# Date : 27/12/25
# Aim:
To build a C program that prints integer, float,character, and string literals on the console using the printf() function.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3: 
  Inside the main() function, use printf() to display each literal along with its size in bytes using sizeof() :
  
   3.1 Integer literal (e.g., 10) using `%d`
   
   3.2 Float literal (e.g., 3.14) using `%f`
   
   3.3 Character literal (e.g., 'A') using `%c`
   
   3.4 String literal (e.g., "Hello C") using `%s`
   
### Step 4: 
   Stop
# Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Integer: %d, Size: %zu bytes\n", 10, sizeof(10));
    printf("Float: %f, Size: %zu bytes\n", 3.14, sizeof(3.14));
    printf("Character: %c, Size: %zu bytes\n", 'A', sizeof('A'));
    printf("String: %s, Size: %zu bytes\n", "Hello C", sizeof("Hello C"));

    return 0;
}
```

# Result: 
Thus, the program was implemented and executed successfully, and the required output was obtained.

# Ex.No:2
  Build a C program to display the value of a macro constant and a constant variable.
# Date : 
# Aim:
  To build a C program that demonstrates the use of macro constants and constant variables.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start  
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3: 
  Define a macro constant `PI` with value `3.14159` using `#define`.
### Step 4: 
   Inside `main()`:
   
   4.1 Declare a constant integer variable `DAYS`
   
   4.2 Initialize it with the value `7`
   
### Step 5:  
  Use `printf()` to display the values of `PI` and `DAYS`.     
### Step 6:  
  Stop
# Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>

#define PI 3.14159

int main() {
    const int DAYS = 7;

    printf("Value of PI (Macro): %f\n", PI);
    printf("Value of DAYS (Constant Variable): %d\n", DAYS);

    return 0;
}
